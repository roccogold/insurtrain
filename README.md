A decentralized insurance solution that combines Business Process Modeling (BPMN 2.0) and smart contracts to automatically compensate passengers for train delays, removing intermediaries and enabling trustless collaboration between insurers, travelers, and railway operators.

## Abstract
Insurtrain reimagines travel insurance by leveraging blockchain technology to create a transparent, automated claims system. When trains are delayed beyond 10 minutes, passengers receive instant compensationâ€”no paperwork, no waiting. The system uses BPMN 2.0 choreography to orchestrate interactions between mutually untrusting parties, while oracle networks fetch real-time train data from railway APIs to trigger payouts automatically[^1][^2].

## Key Features
- **Automated Claims Processing**: Compensation triggered within minutes of delay verification
- **BPMN-Based Smart Contracts**: Visual workflow modeling using BPMN
- **Blockchain Transparency**: Immutable transaction records on private blockchain
- **Parametric Insurance Model**: 
  - Premium calculation based on travel distance (5-7% of ticket price)
  - Compensation tiers (50-100% of ticket value)
- **Oracle Integration**: Real-time train status verification through API connections

## Workflow Overview
### Multi-Party Choreography (Orchestica)

## Footnotes
This project was developed as a Master's thesis exploring the intersection of blockchain technology, process automation, and parametric insurance. The implementation uses a private blockchain testnet and simulated data sources to demonstrate proof-of-concept viability before production deployment.
